## About

CloudSight is an open-source, multi-cloud serverless observability platform that solves the critical enterprise problem of distributed tracing blindness in complex serverless architectures. It provides correlated telemetry across functions, services, and cloud providers with AI-powered insights for performance and cost optimization.

Traditional observability tools struggle with the ephemeral, distributed nature of serverless architectures. CloudSight bridges this gap by delivering a unified view across cloud providers, automatically correlating events across service boundaries, and applying machine learning to detect anomalies before they impact your business.

Our platform serves enterprises running mission-critical serverless workloads at scale, enabling them to reduce Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) by 3x, identify cost spikes 14 days earlier, and gain visibility into cold start impacts on business metrics. By providing a single pane of glass across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, CloudSight eliminates the operational overhead of maintaining separate observability stacks for each cloud provider.

Built on open-source principles with enterprise-ready features, CloudSight leverages free-tier cloud services for cost-effective deployment while maintaining the scalability needed for production workloads processing millions of events per minute.

---

## The Problem

### Enterprise Pain Points

**68% of enterprises run serverless across multiple clouds, but lack unified tracing**

Modern serverless architectures span multiple cloud providers, creating visibility gaps that lead to:

- **Distributed Tracing Fragmentation**: Unable to follow requests across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions
- **Cold Start Impact Blindness**: No correlation between cold starts and business metrics like cart abandonment
- **Cost Anomaly Detection Lag**: Average 14-day delay in identifying cost spikes in serverless environments
- **Multi-Service Debugging Hell**: MTTR increases 3x when issues span multiple serverless services

### Real-World Impact

| Impact Area | Consequences |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Financial** | One enterprise lost $84,000 in 48 hours from a recursive Lambda invocation |
| **Performance** | E-commerce company saw 23% cart abandonment during cold start chains |
| **Operational** | Team spent 146 hours monthly correlating logs across 12 serverless services |

**CloudSight solves these problems with unified observability, AI-powered insights, and real-time correlation across your entire serverless stack.**

## Architecture

### System Architecture Overview

CloudSight follows a distributed, cloud-native architecture designed for high throughput, low latency, and horizontal scalability. The platform processes millions of telemetry events per minute while maintaining sub-10 second event-to-dashboard latency.

### Architecture Layers

#### 1. **Agent & Collection Layer**
The CloudSight Agent SDK instruments serverless functions across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. Built on OpenTelemetry standards, agents capture invocation metrics, distributed traces, custom events, and cold start telemetry with minimal performance overhead (<5ms per invocation).

#### 2. **Ingestion & Streaming Layer**
Cloud-native streaming services (AWS Kinesis, GCP Pub/Sub, Azure Event Hubs) provide durable, scalable ingestion pipelines. The layer automatically handles backpressure, supports multi-region replication, and ensures at-least-once delivery semantics for critical telemetry data.

#### 3. **Processing & Enrichment Layer**
Apache Flink and cloud-native stream processors perform real-time data transformation, correlation, and enrichment. This layer executes automatic service dependency discovery, trace stitching across cloud boundaries, and metric aggregation with configurable time windows.

#### 4. **Storage & Persistence Layer**
Hybrid storage strategy optimizes for different access patterns:
- **ClickHouse**: Columnar time-series database for fast analytical queries
- **Elasticsearch**: Full-text search for logs and trace exploration
- **Object Storage**: Cost-effective archival for compliance and historical analysis

#### 5. **Intelligence & Analytics Layer**
Machine learning models run continuously on telemetry streams to detect anomalies, predict scaling needs, and identify cost optimization opportunities. Models include Isolation Forest for outlier detection, ARIMA for forecasting, and neural networks for pattern recognition.

#### 6. **API & Presentation Layer**
GraphQL and REST APIs provide programmatic access to all platform capabilities. The React-based dashboard delivers real-time visualizations with WebSocket updates, customizable views, and role-based access control for enterprise deployments.
